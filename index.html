    <h1>YOUTH ENVIRONMENTAL & WASTE MANAGEMENT TEAM</h1>
    <h5>A healthy environment is a healthy life</h5>
    <p>Environmental conservation is an essential emerging trend amidst the devastating environmental pollution which is aimed at reducing, reusing, and recycling both organic & inorganic waste.
        <br>
        Youth Environmental & Waste Management Team is driven by the desire to promote healthy environments which contributes to healthy living outcomes among communities.
        <br>
        <br>
        <p></p>
        <br>
        The desire to reduce & manage waste is aligned with the overall goal of Kenya's National Climate Change Action Plan (KNCCAP) under health, sanitation, and human settlements. YEWMAT is looking to contribute to mainstream climate change adaptation healthwise by increasing the resilience of human settlements through improved waste management in rural & urban areas
